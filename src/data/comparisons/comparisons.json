    "verdict": "These filters serve fundamentally different purposes and many fishkeepers use both. Sponge filters excel in breeding tanks, hospital tanks, shrimp setups, and as supplemental biological filtration. Canister filters are the primary filtration workhorses for display tanks over 30 gallons where aesthetics and filtration power matter. For a single display tank, go canister. For a fish room with multiple small tanks, sponge filters are unbeatable on cost and reliability.",

        "question": "Can a sponge filter be the only filter in a tank?",
        "answer": "Yes, for lightly stocked tanks under 20 gallons, a sponge filter provides adequate biological filtration. For heavily stocked or larger tanks, pair it with a more powerful primary filter."

      {
        "question": "How do I reduce air pump noise from a sponge filter?",
        "answer": "Place the air pump on a soft surface like a sponge pad, use a check valve, and choose a quality quiet pump like the USB nano pumps or Tetra Whisper series. Hanging the pump from a hook instead of setting it on a hard surface also reduces vibration noise significantly."
