      { "question": "How often should I feed my betta fish?", "answer": "Feed your betta 2-3 small pellets twice a day. Bettas have small stomachs, about the size of their eye, so overfeeding is a common mistake. Consider fasting one day per week to aid digestion." },
      { "question": "Do betta fish need a heater?", "answer": "Yes, bettas are tropical fish that require water temperatures between 76-82°F (24-28°C). A reliable heater is essential unless your room temperature consistently stays in this range." }

      { "question": "Can I add fish during cycling?", "answer": "Fish-in cycling is possible but not recommended as it exposes fish to harmful ammonia and nitrite. If you must, use very hardy fish and perform frequent water changes with a dechlorinator like Seachem Prime." }

      { "question": "What substrate is best for planted tanks?", "answer": "Active substrates like Fluval Stratum or Eco-Complete are ideal as they provide nutrients and buffer pH. Inert substrates like sand can work with root tabs for supplementation." }

      { "question": "What are the best community fish for beginners?", "answer": "Neon tetras, corydoras catfish, cherry barbs, and guppies are excellent choices. They are peaceful, hardy, and tolerant of a range of water parameters." }
