## Daily Tasks

Daily maintenance is brief but essential for catching problems early. Check your aquarium temperature to confirm the heater is functioning properly. Observe your fish during feeding for changes in behavior, appetite, or appearance. Lethargy, clamped fins, spots, or loss of color can indicate stress or disease.

Verify that the filter is running and producing visible water flow. Count your fish to ensure none are missing or hiding due to illness. Remove any dead plant leaves or uneaten food visible on the substrate. These quick visual inspections take only a few minutes and are your first line of defense against developing issues.

## Weekly Tasks

Perform a 20 to 30 percent water change using dechlorinated water matched to the tank temperature. Use a gravel vacuum to siphon debris from the substrate surface, focusing on areas where waste tends to accumulate such as corners and around decorations.

Test your water parameters with a liquid test kit, checking ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH. Record the results so you can spot trends over time. Clean the inside glass with an algae scraper or magnetic cleaner. Trim any overgrown plants and remove dead or dying leaves. Rinse filter intake sponges in old tank water if flow appears reduced.

## Monthly Tasks

Once a month, perform deeper maintenance on your filtration system. Rinse mechanical filter media in a bucket of old tank water to preserve beneficial bacteria. Never rinse filter media under tap water, as chlorine and chloramine will destroy your bacterial colony. Replace chemical media such as activated carbon according to the manufacturer's schedule, typically every four to six weeks.

Inspect your heater, air pump, and any other equipment for wear or malfunction. Check airline tubing for cracks or blockages. Clean light fixtures of dust and salt creep to maintain proper output. Prune plants more aggressively if they are blocking light to lower growth, and replant healthy cuttings to fill sparse areas.

## Equipment Maintenance

Filter impellers should be removed and cleaned every two to three months, as buildup reduces efficiency and can cause motor failure. Disassemble the impeller housing, remove debris, and check for wear on the impeller shaft and gaskets.

Heaters should be inspected for cracks or corrosion on the glass tube and the suction cups that hold them in place. Replace suction cups annually as they harden and lose grip. Air stones lose porosity over time and should be replaced every few months when bubble output diminishes. Test backup equipment like battery-operated air pumps periodically so they are ready during power outages.

## Seasonal Considerations

During summer months, rising ambient temperatures can push tank water above safe ranges. Increase surface agitation for gas exchange, reduce lighting duration to lower heat output, and consider a clip-on fan directed across the water surface for evaporative cooling. Monitor evaporation rates closely and top off with dechlorinated water to prevent salinity and mineral concentration spikes.

In winter, ensure your heater has adequate wattage to maintain stable temperatures as room temperatures drop. Insulate tanks near exterior walls or drafty windows. Power outages are more common in winter, so keep battery-powered air pumps and insulating blankets accessible. Reduce feeding slightly if your tank runs cooler, as fish metabolism slows with temperature and overfeeding in cooler water leads to waste accumulation.
