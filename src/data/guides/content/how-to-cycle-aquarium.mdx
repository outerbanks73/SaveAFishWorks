## What is the Nitrogen Cycle

The nitrogen cycle is the biological process that converts toxic fish waste into less harmful compounds. Fish produce ammonia through respiration and waste, which is highly toxic even at low concentrations. Beneficial bacteria called Nitrosomonas colonize filter media and surfaces, converting ammonia into nitrite. A second group, Nitrobacter, then converts nitrite into nitrate, which is relatively harmless at low levels and removed through water changes.

Establishing these bacterial colonies before adding fish is critical. Without a cycled tank, ammonia and nitrite levels spike rapidly, causing stress, disease, and often death in what is commonly known as "new tank syndrome."

## Fishless Cycling Step by Step

Set up your tank with filter, heater, and substrate, then add a source of ammonia. Pure ammonium chloride solution dosed to 2 to 4 ppm is the most controlled method. Alternatively, fish food or a raw shrimp can decompose and produce ammonia, though dosing is less precise.

Dose ammonia and let the filter run continuously. After one to two weeks, you should begin detecting nitrite in your tests. Continue dosing ammonia to keep the bacteria fed. Over the next several weeks, nitrite-consuming bacteria will establish, and you will see nitrite levels fall while nitrates rise.

## Testing Your Water

A liquid test kit is essential during cycling. Test for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH every two to three days. Record your results to track progress. You should observe ammonia rising first, then nitrite appearing as ammonia drops, and finally nitrate accumulating as nitrite declines.

Avoid test strips for cycling purposes, as they are less accurate than liquid reagent kits. Consistent testing is the only reliable way to know where you stand in the cycling process.

## When is Cycling Complete

Your tank is fully cycled when it can process 2 ppm of ammonia down to zero ammonia and zero nitrite within 24 hours, with nitrates present as the end product. This typically takes four to eight weeks, though it can vary based on temperature, pH, and whether beneficial bacteria were seeded from an established tank.

Once cycling is complete, perform a large water change of 50 to 75 percent to bring nitrates down before adding fish. Add livestock gradually over several weeks to allow the bacterial colony to adjust to increasing bioload.

## Fish-In Cycling

Fish-in cycling means establishing the nitrogen cycle with fish already in the tank. This approach is stressful and potentially harmful to fish, but sometimes unavoidable. If you must fish-in cycle, stock very lightly, feed sparingly, and perform daily water changes of 25 to 50 percent to keep ammonia and nitrite below 0.25 ppm.

Use a liquid test kit daily and dose a water conditioner that detoxifies ammonia, such as products containing sodium thiosulfate and ammonia-binding agents. Add bottled beneficial bacteria to accelerate the process. Expect the cycle to take longer than fishless methods, and monitor your fish closely for signs of distress.
