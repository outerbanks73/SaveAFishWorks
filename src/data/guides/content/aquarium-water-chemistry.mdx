## Understanding pH

pH measures how acidic or alkaline your water is on a scale from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Most freshwater aquarium fish thrive in a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5, though specific species may prefer more acidic or alkaline conditions. African cichlids, for example, prefer pH values of 7.8 to 8.6, while many South American species do best below 7.0.

A stable pH matters more than a perfect number. Rapid pH swings stress fish far more than a consistently slightly off-target value. Driftwood and Indian almond leaves naturally lower pH over time, while crushed coral and limestone raise it. Avoid chemical pH adjusters unless you fully understand their effects, as they can cause dangerous fluctuations.

## The Nitrogen Compounds

Three nitrogen compounds define aquarium water safety. Ammonia is produced directly by fish waste and decomposing organic matter. Even concentrations as low as 0.25 ppm cause gill damage and stress. Beneficial bacteria convert ammonia into nitrite, which is equally toxic at low levels and interferes with oxygen transport in fish blood.

The final conversion produces nitrate, which is far less toxic but accumulates over time. Keeping nitrate below 20 ppm through regular water changes protects fish health and discourages algae growth. In a properly cycled and maintained tank, ammonia and nitrite should always read zero.

## Water Hardness

Water hardness is measured in two forms. General hardness (GH) represents the concentration of dissolved calcium and magnesium, which are important for fish osmoregulation, shell development in invertebrates, and plant nutrition. Carbonate hardness (KH) measures bicarbonate and carbonate ions, which act as a pH buffer preventing dangerous swings.

Most community fish tolerate GH between 4 and 12 dGH and KH between 3 and 8 dKH. Low KH makes your water vulnerable to sudden pH crashes, particularly overnight when plants release carbon dioxide. If your tap water is very soft, consider adding a remineralizer or including crushed coral in your filter to maintain a safe KH buffer.

## Temperature Stability

Tropical freshwater fish generally require temperatures between 74 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. A reliable heater with a built-in thermostat is essential for maintaining consistency. Choose a heater rated at approximately 3 to 5 watts per gallon, and position it near a flow source for even heat distribution.

Temperature fluctuations of more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit within a few hours stress fish and weaken immune responses. Avoid placing tanks near windows, exterior walls, or heating and cooling vents. During water changes, match the replacement water temperature to the tank within one degree to prevent thermal shock.

## Testing and Monitoring

Invest in a reliable liquid reagent test kit that covers ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, GH, and KH. Test weekly during normal operation and daily during cycling or when troubleshooting problems. Record results in a log to identify trends before they become crises.

Digital thermometers provide more accurate readings than adhesive strip thermometers. A TDS (total dissolved solids) meter offers a quick snapshot of overall mineral content, useful for tracking changes between water changes. Establish a baseline for your tap water parameters so you understand what you are adding to the tank with each water change and can adjust accordingly.
