## Choosing a Substrate

Substrate choice is foundational for a successful planted tank. Active substrates like aquasoils are nutrient-rich and buffer pH downward, making them ideal for demanding plant species. They provide iron, potassium, and other essential nutrients directly to plant roots.

Inert substrates such as sand or gravel work well for undemanding plants, especially when paired with root tabs for supplemental feeding. A grain size of 1 to 3 millimeters is optimal for root development. Avoid very fine sand that compacts and creates anaerobic pockets, and very coarse gravel that allows debris to settle deep between gaps. A substrate depth of 2 to 3 inches gives roots adequate room to anchor and spread.

## Lighting Requirements

Light drives photosynthesis and is the single most important factor in plant growth. For beginners, moderate lighting in the range of 30 to 50 PAR at substrate level supports a wide variety of plants without encouraging excessive algae. LED fixtures designed for planted tanks offer adjustable intensity and energy efficiency.

Run lights on a consistent photoperiod of 6 to 8 hours per day using a timer. Longer light periods do not benefit plants proportionally but do encourage algae blooms. If algae becomes a problem, reduce the photoperiod or intensity before making other changes. Gradually increase light duration as plants establish and fill in.

## Beginner Plants

Start with hardy, low-demand species that tolerate a range of conditions. Java fern and anubias attach to hardscape rather than planting in substrate, making them versatile and forgiving. Cryptocorynes are excellent root feeders that adapt to various lighting levels, though they may melt initially before regrowing.

Stem plants like water wisteria and hornwort grow quickly and help absorb excess nutrients during the early stages. Floating plants such as red root floaters or frogbit provide shade and nutrient export. A mix of slow and fast growers creates visual interest while maintaining biological balance in the tank.

## Fertilization

Plants require macronutrients including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as micronutrients like iron, manganese, and boron. In tanks with moderate fish stocking, fish waste supplies some nitrogen and phosphorus, but potassium and micronutrients typically need supplementation.

Liquid fertilizers dosed according to the manufacturer's instructions cover water-column feeding plants. Root tabs inserted into the substrate every few months benefit heavy root feeders like swords and cryptocorynes. Carbon dioxide injection dramatically increases growth rates and allows you to keep more demanding species, but it is not necessary for a beginner setup. Liquid carbon supplements offer a milder alternative.

## Maintenance Tips

Trim stem plants regularly to prevent them from overshadowing lower growth. Cut stems can be replanted to fill in sparse areas. Remove dead or decaying leaves promptly to avoid nutrient spikes and algae triggers.

Perform weekly water changes of 25 to 30 percent to replenish trace minerals and remove excess nitrates. Gently vacuum the substrate surface without disturbing plant roots. Clean filter intake sponges monthly to maintain flow. Monitor plant health by watching for yellowing leaves, which may indicate nutrient deficiencies, and adjust fertilization accordingly.
