## Tank Setup

Betta fish require a minimum tank size of 5 gallons, though 10 gallons is preferable for long-term health. Avoid small bowls and vases, as these do not provide adequate space or filtration. Equip the tank with a gentle filter, since bettas are not strong swimmers and can become stressed by powerful currents. A sponge filter or an adjustable hang-on-back filter set to low flow works well.

Include a heater to maintain stable tropical temperatures. Bettas also appreciate hiding spots such as caves, driftwood, and live or silk plants. Avoid sharp plastic decorations that can tear their delicate fins. A lid is essential, as bettas are known jumpers.

## Water Parameters

Bettas thrive in water temperatures between 76 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The ideal pH range is 6.5 to 7.5, and water hardness should be kept between 3 and 4 dGH. Ammonia and nitrite levels must remain at zero, while nitrates should stay below 20 ppm.

Perform weekly water changes of 20 to 25 percent to maintain water quality. Always treat new water with a dechlorinator before adding it to the tank. Sudden swings in temperature or pH are more dangerous than slightly imperfect parameters, so focus on consistency.

## Feeding

Feed your betta a varied diet based on high-quality betta pellets as the staple. Supplement with frozen or freeze-dried bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia two to three times per week. Bettas are carnivorous and need protein-rich foods to stay healthy.

Offer only what your betta can consume in two minutes, once or twice daily. Overfeeding leads to bloating, constipation, and degraded water quality. Fasting one day per week can help prevent digestive issues.

## Common Health Issues

Fin rot is one of the most frequent betta ailments, typically caused by poor water quality or bacterial infection. Symptoms include frayed, discolored, or receding fins. Improving water conditions is the first line of treatment, followed by aquarium salt or antibacterial medication if needed.

Ich presents as small white spots on the body and fins. Raising the temperature to 82 degrees Fahrenheit and using an ich-specific treatment will usually resolve it. Swim bladder disorder, often caused by overfeeding, results in difficulty swimming or floating at odd angles. Fasting for two to three days followed by feeding a blanched, deshelled pea can help.

## Tank Mates

Bettas can coexist with peaceful, non-flashy species in tanks of 10 gallons or larger. Suitable companions include corydoras catfish, kuhli loaches, snails such as nerites, and small schooling fish like ember tetras or harlequin rasboras.

Avoid fin-nipping species like tiger barbs and anything with long, colorful fins that a betta might perceive as a rival. Never house two male bettas together. Always have a backup plan to separate fish if aggression occurs, and monitor interactions closely during the first week.
