## Planning Your Community

A successful community tank starts with careful planning before purchasing any fish. Begin by deciding on your tank size, as this determines stocking capacity and species options. A 20-gallon tank is a practical minimum for a diverse community, while 40 gallons and above offer significantly more flexibility.

Research the adult size, temperament, and environmental needs of every species you consider. Group fish by their preferred water parameters, particularly temperature and pH ranges. Aim for a balanced composition across swimming levels: top dwellers, mid-level schoolers, and bottom feeders. This reduces territorial overlap and creates a more dynamic, natural-looking display.

## Compatible Species

Peaceful tetras such as neon tetras, cardinal tetras, and rummy-nose tetras make excellent mid-level schooling fish. Keep them in groups of six or more for natural behavior and reduced stress. Rasboras, particularly harlequin and chili rasboras, offer similar temperament with slightly different aesthetics.

For the bottom of the tank, corydoras catfish are sociable and should be kept in groups of at least four. Otocinclus catfish help with algae control and are peaceful additions. Dwarf gouramis or honey gouramis can serve as a centerpiece species, providing color and personality without excessive aggression. Snails and shrimp add a cleanup crew that keeps the tank tidy.

## Stocking Order

Introduce fish to your cycled tank in a deliberate order. Add the most timid and peaceful species first so they can establish territory and comfort before bolder fish arrive. Bottom dwellers and small schooling fish are good first additions.

Wait at least one to two weeks between adding new groups, allowing the biological filter to adjust to the increased bioload. Add semi-aggressive or territorial species last, as they are less likely to claim the entire tank if other inhabitants are already established. Quarantine new arrivals for two weeks in a separate tank when possible to prevent introducing disease.

## Feeding a Community Tank

Diverse species require diverse foods. Use a high-quality flake or micro-pellet as the daily staple for mid-level fish. Sinking pellets or wafers ensure bottom dwellers receive their share. Supplement with frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia two to three times per week.

Feed small amounts twice daily rather than one large feeding. Observe to make sure food reaches all levels of the tank. If surface feeders consume everything before it sinks, try feeding at different ends of the tank simultaneously or using feeding rings to contain floating food while dropping sinking pellets in another area.

## Troubleshooting Aggression

Aggression in community tanks often stems from overcrowding, insufficient hiding spots, or incompatible species. Add more plants, driftwood, and rock formations to break sightlines and create territorial boundaries.

If a specific fish is persistently aggressive, observe whether it is guarding a territory, breeding, or simply incompatible. Rearranging the hardscape can reset territorial claims. Increasing school sizes sometimes reduces aggression within a species by distributing dominant behavior. As a last resort, rehome the aggressive individual rather than allowing ongoing stress that weakens the immune systems of tank mates.
